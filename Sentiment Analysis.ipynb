    "The project involves going through the 7 basic steps to building a Classification model<br>\n",
    "Step 1: Collecting Movie reviews input as individual text files and combining them into 2 lists based on the sentiment - Train and Test <br>\n",
    "Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis to check if the distribution of comments is even in Test and Train datsets <br>\n",
    "Step 3: Outlier Treatment to better understand the dataset <br>\n",
    "Step 4: Perform Vectorization - To convert text into one large matrix of unique words with their importance scores. This matrix with scores will be used as features of the model <br>\n",
    "Step 5: Train the classifier using Logistic Regression package (Check for max. accuracy by changing hyperparameter)\n",
    "Step 6: Testing the model on test data and Evaluating it using Confusion matrix and ROC curve <br>\n",
    "Step 7: Knowing the Top 5 Positive and Negitive words used by People in their reviews\n",
    "Step 8: Plotting the top 10 good and bad words to get a genralized idea on their importance\n",

Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences, of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet, and Costner's character are realized early on, and then forgotten until much later, by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky, overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker, Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here, it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.\""

       " 'first of all i hate those moronic rappers who couldnt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clichée version of gangsters the movie doesnt take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before were already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie except for the homeless guy who is also the only one with half a brain bill paxton and william sadler are both hill billies and sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters i didnt like him right from the start the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills specialty people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no one everybody dies except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but theyre actors by profession not annoying ugly brain dead rappers stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead at lest they have characters you care about a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast',\n",
       " 'not even the beatles could write songs everyone liked and although walter hill is no mop top hes second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies the nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film the emergence of the rapper turned movie star was in full swing the acting took a back seat to each mans overpowering regional accent and transparent acting this was one of the many ice t movies i saw as a kid and loved only to watch them later and cringe bill paxton and william sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications i hand it to walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location but i fault everyone involved for turning out lame o performances ice t and cube must have been red hot at this time and while ive enjoyed both their careers as rappers in my opinion they fell flat in this movie its about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief now this is a movie its not a documentary so i wont waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie but there were many and they led nowhere i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was sord of confused and just playing things off the cuff there are two things i still enjoy about it one involves a scene with a needle and the other is sadlers huge 45 pistol bottom line this movie is like dominos pizza yeah ill eat it if im hungry and i dont feel like cooking but im well aware it tastes like crap 3 stars meh',\n",
       " 'brass pictures movies is not a fitting word for them really are somewhat brassy their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class tv commercials but unfortunately brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours in this they fail miserably their undeniable but rather soft and flabby than steamy erotic qualities non withstanding senso 45 is a remake of a film by luchino visconti with the same title and alida valli and farley granger in the lead the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around venice during the italian wars of independence brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century 1945 to be exact so there are mussolini murals men in black shirts german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans but it is just window dressing the historic context is completely negligible anna galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral ss guy who always puts on too much lipstick she is an attractive versatile well trained italian actress and clearly above the material her wide range of facial expressions signalling boredom loathing delight fear hate  and ecstasy are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars she endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity i wish some really good parts come along for her she really deserves it']"
